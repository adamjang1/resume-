<h1>what got me into software development</h1>

<hr>

<p>
    I have always been intrigued about Inforation technology but for some reason i pivoted into business administration for college while still keeping the passion that i had for IT in general alive.
    MOved into network engineering where i have been able to understand more concepts and i feel comfortable in my current role as anetwork engineer. 
    being comrtable has never been something i took pride in and i find myself coming back to learning software and web dev concepts
    the exceitment that goes into learning HTML alone knows no bounds and I finally belive with a lot of conviction that i have found something that i really love!
